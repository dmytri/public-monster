        <blockquote>
            Inspired by the <a href="https://ckohtala.github.io/" target="_blank">Caring Community Guidelines</a> by P2P Left.

        <h2><span class="emoji">💭</span> Our Philosophy: Creative Freedom Meets Community Care</h2>
        
        <div class="pink-box">
            <p><strong>Welcome to the neighborhood!</strong> We believe the web should be fun, creative, diverse, and a little bit weird. This is your corner of the internet to build whatever you want. Our moderation approach is guided by a simple principle: <strong>maximum creative freedom with the minimum necessary rules to prevent harm.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>We are not a faceless corporation, and this isn't a sanitized "public square." We are a community with values. We explicitly welcome and protect content that is political, controversial, experimental, and counter-cultural. We believe in compassionate dialogue and the right to make mistakes and grow.</p>

        <p>Our rules are designed to protect people, not to police ideas. We will always consider context, intent, and artistic merit. We are more interested in preventing genuine harm than we are in enforcing "civility."</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">✨</span> What We Encourage (The Cool Stuff)</h2>
        
        <div class="green-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal & Political Expression:</strong> Art portfolios, personal blogs, fan sites, political zines, radical theory, and manifestos. We welcome content that is critical of power structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Heterodox Perspectives:</strong> We explicitly make space for Marxist, Communist, Anarchist, Feminist, Postcolonial, Abolitionist, Racial Justice, Queer, Hacker, and Pirate cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>Weird Internet Art:</strong> Glitch art, "cursed" content, interactive experiments, and anything that pushes the boundaries of a static webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>NSFW & Difficult Topics:</strong> Artistic nudity, profanity, dark humor, and satire are allowed. We trust you and your audience to handle mature themes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🚫</span> What We Prohibit (The Uncool Stuff)</h2>
        
        <p>This is not an exhaustive list, but it outlines the clear boundaries. If your site hosts any of the following, you will be asked to remove it.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Prohibited Examples</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Illegal Material</strong></td>
                <td>Hosting pirated movies ("warez"), stolen credit card databases, or Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Malicious Code</strong></td>
                <td>A fake bank login page (phishing), a script that mines cryptocurrency on a visitor's machine, or a link that downloads a virus.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Direct Harm & Harassment</strong></td>
                <td>Posting someone's home address and telling people to "go get them" (doxxing), coordinating a pile-on against an individual, or posting non-consensual intimate photos.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Hate Speech</strong></td>
                <td>A website dedicated to arguing that a specific race is inferior or that a particular gender identity is invalid. This is different from discussing or critiquing systems of power.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Reactionary Narratives</strong></td>
                <td>A blog post claiming that "reverse racism" is the real problem, that feminism is about hating men, or that white men are the most oppressed group in society. These narratives invert reality and are not welcome here.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🔍</span> How We Detect & Review Content</h2>
        
        <div class="blue-box">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Automated Scanning:</strong> We proactively scan for known CSAM hashes and obvious malware signatures. This is the only automated moderation we do.</li>
                <li><strong>User Reports:</strong> Anyone can report a site that they believe violates our policies. Reports are submitted via a simple form, and the reporter's identity is always kept private.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Review:</strong> Every single report is reviewed by a human. We do not use bots to make moderation decisions. We will look at the context of the content before taking action.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">⚖️</span> Our Enforcement Process: A Graduated Approach</h2>
        
        <p>We believe in communication and giving people a chance to correct mistakes. Unless the violation is severe (like CSAM or active malware), we follow these steps:</p>

        <div class="step-box">
            <span class="emoji">1️⃣</span> <strong>A Friendly Warning:</strong> We will send you an email explaining the specific issue and which policy has been violated. We'll give you <strong>7 days</strong> to remove the content yourself.
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <span class="emoji">2️⃣</span> <strong>Content Removal:</strong> If the content isn't removed after 7 days, we will remove the specific files from your site, but your account will remain active.
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <span class="emoji">3️⃣</span> <strong>Temporary Suspension (A "Time Out"):</strong> For repeat offenses, we may suspend your account for 30 days. You can be reinstated after acknowledging the violation.
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <span class="emoji">4️⃣</span> <strong>Permanent Ban:</strong> For severe violations or for users who repeatedly and knowingly violate our policies, we will permanently ban the account.
        </div>

        <div class="yellow-box">
            <p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> For the most serious violations—such as CSAM, active malware distribution, or credible threats of violence—we will take immediate action, which may include immediate account termination and reporting to law enforcement.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🗣️</span> The Appeals Process: Let's Talk</h2>
        
        <p>We're human, and we can make mistakes. If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you have <strong>14 days</strong> to appeal.</p>

        <div class="green-box">
            <p><strong>To appeal, reply to our decision email and provide:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context we may have missed.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>An explanation of your intent.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Any corrective actions you have already taken.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Your appeal will be reviewed by a different moderator than the one who made the initial decision. We are committed to the principle of "the right to make mistakes and grow," and genuine misunderstandings will be given a second chance. We will respond to all appeals within 7 days. The decision of the appeal review is final.</p>
